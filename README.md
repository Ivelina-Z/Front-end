# Front-end

In this repository codes for front-end based HTML and CSS are included. Most of the folders are part of preparation from "HTML & CSS" exam.

The main task for first and third assignment is to create a web page that looks like and behaves like the `original_photo.png`. The first consists of few, identical elements, ex. log in form or services page. The third task is a more complex page. 

For the second task a non-responsive web page is provided (HTML and CSS) and it should be made responsive without changing the original data and as close as possible to the provided image. For some exams the page needs to be made responsibe for both tablet and phone resolutions, for anothers - only for phone.
